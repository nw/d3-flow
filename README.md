## d3-flow

A flow control library to help manage complex animations in d3.

### Overview

This is old code I dug up that I once again have a purpose for. It is really helpful for managing transition states. It has a middleware type system which makes it easy to abstract the functionality into reusable chunks.

**Warning:** This was originally designed for D3 v2.x. It currently has some issues with D3 v3. This will be resolved soon.
